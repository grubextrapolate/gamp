from command line:
------------------

usage: gamp [options] [mp3/m3u file(s)]
options: -c, --config filename  load/save config file
         -l, --logo filename    load this ascii logo
         -d, --dir dirname      start in dirname
         -h, --help             display this help info
         -v, --version          display version
         -p, --play             start playing on startup
         -s, --setup            sets up ~/.gamp/

anything else on the command line will be ignored. this is to more easily
facilitate auto-loading a bunch of mp3s via something like:

	gamp /mp3/*

which will ignore all files in /mp3/ that are neither playlists nor
mp3s.

some examples of this could be:

        gamp --setup
	gamp -c sample.config.amp
	gamp -config sample.config.sajber /mp3/all.m3u
	gamp -l logos/gamp.logo2 -c /dev/null mp3/*
	gamp --logo logos/gamp.logo
	gamp -v
	gamp --version
	gamp -h
	gamp --help

i am considering putting in a '-d dirname' option in order to make gamp
start up in the specified directory, possibly loading all mp3s it sees
there. another variation on this could be to have '-D dirname' recursively
load all files in a specified directory. if you are interested in these
features, let me know.
