FIX ME:

   -put delay in spectrum analyzer. presently displays frame info as it is
    buffered and NOT as it is displayed. the analyzer is on the back
    burner right now while other more important features are improved
   -ffwd and rew not yet functional.
   -volume wont work if using buffered playback
