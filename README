1. Introduction

amp (Audio Mpeg Player) is an MPEG audio decoder which I originally started 
putting together as a side project of the MPEG hardware design project at 
FER/Zagreb - just to confirm my knowledge of the standard. It works with
both MPEG1 and MPEG2 audio streams (except for the multichannel extensions
defined in MPEG2), layer3 only for now. 

There is a gui for amp, written in Tcl/Tk by Edouard Lafargue. It is 
available at the amp home site ftp://ftp.rasip.fer.hr

The following people contributed their time and knowledge to amp:

   Karl Anders Oygard
   Ilkka Karvinen
   Lutz Vieweg
   Dan Nelson
   Edouard Lafargue
   Andrew Richards
   George Colouris
   Dmitry Boldyrev (Mac port)
   Andy Lo A Foe (BeOS port)



amp home location is

2. Installation

- edit the makefile to suit your system. (FreeBSD users should
  choose the Linux options).

make
(as root) mv amp  usr/local/bin      (or wherever)   
amp

If you had version 0.7.0 installed, don't forget to remove the
table files - they are not needed anymore.

3. Running:

'amp' gives you usage & options. If your computer is on the slower
side, direct playback might not work, but you can decode it
to .wav or raw pcm and play it later.


4. Feedback

Send in your makefiles, opinions, bugreports, fixes; anything related to this
program. You can also send me unlimited amounts of money, sugar, milk, etc.

If you find any mpeg audio files that amp has trouble decoding, please tell
me about this via e-mail <tuzelac@rasip.fer.hr>.


5. Contributing

Please contribute to amp. If you want to know what is going on in amp 
development, you can join the developers mailing list

	mpeg_audio_developers@rasip.fer.hr

There are certain debugging facilities that I made in amp, but are disabled
in the current release (they are neither nice nor user-friendly). If anyone
enhances them (they are in dump.c) to the point that they're actually
usable I'll be happy to include the changes in the release. I think this
kind of debug output would be very useful to people studying these audio
algorithms.
