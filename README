1. Introduction

gamp is Graphical AMP. it is an ncurses front end built onto Tomislav
Uzelac's amp mp3 player and designed to be a true alternative to x windows
mp3 players. as such it incorperates a playlist browser, play, pause,
stop, prev, next options. work is in progress on a text-based frequency
analyzer, fast forward, and rewind functions. more ideas as they come. at
present this program has been tested only under linux on both the redhat
and debian distributions. please feel free to drop us a line with
any suggestions, comments, or bug reports.

the frequency analyzer and time remaining functions were based on elements
of xmms by Peter Alm, Thomas Nilsson, Olle Hallnas. xmms is available at
http://www.xmms.org/.

begining with version 0.2.0 gamp now includes elements of id3ren by Robert
Alto <badcrc@tscnet.com>. i borrowed some of the functions from his id3
renamer which are used in reading id3 tags from mp3s. further information
on this program can be found at http://tscnet.com/pages/badcrc/apps/id3ren/

the present webpage for gamp can be found at
http://www.cs.umn.edu/~wburdick/gamp/. i may put up a domain for it in the
future, but right now my cs account is adequate and i dont have to worry
much about bandwidth.

2. Installation

ok, this works for me so try it yourself and see what happens. let me know
if you have any trouble.

	./configure
	make

at this point you can copy the gamp file to wherever you like. may need to
be root to do this. for example,

	mv gamp  usr/local/bin

3. Running:

to use the program just type 'gamp'. you can pass it a single command line
argument (the start directory) if you so desire. by default it will start
up in the current directory.

	gamp
or
	gamp /mp3

alternately, you can set the environmental variable GAMPDIR to specify the
directory in which gamp will start. the order of usage (if they exist) is:
current dir, GAMPDIR, argument dir. by this i mean that if GAMPDIR is set
and no argument is given it will start in GAMPDIR, but if a command line
argument is given it will start there regardless of whether GAMPDIR is
set.

gamp also takes some of the command line arguments that amp used. you can
specify buffer size (or none at all), get version number, set volume. more
to come with this. 'gamp -h' will show you options.

4. Feedback
