based on amp by Tomislav Uzelac  1996,1997

1. Introduction

gamp is Graphical AMP. it is an ncurses front end built onto Tomislav
Uzelac's amp mp3 player and designed to be a true alternative to x windows
mp3 players. as such it incorperates a playlist browser, play, pause,
stop, prev, next options. work is in progress on a text-based frequency
analyzer, fast forward, and rewind functions. more ideas as they come. at
present this program has been tested only under linux on both the redhat
(5.2) and debian distributions. please feel free to drop us a line with
any suggestions, comments, or bug reports.

at present there isnt really a webpage for gamp but the current version
can be found at http://www.cs.umn.edu/~wburdick/gamp/

2. Installation

ok, this works for me so try it yourself and see what happens. let me know
if you have any trouble.

	./configure
	make

at this point you can copy the gamp file to wherever you like. may need to
be root to do this. for example,

	mv gamp  usr/local/bin

3. Running:

to use the program just type 'gamp'. you can pass it a single command line
argument (the start directory) if you so desire. by default it will start
up in the current directory.

	gamp
or
	gamp /mp3

4. Feedback

program. You can also send me unlimited amounts of money, pepsi, whatever.
